This is a project to get you started with Phonegap 2.9.1 using Android Studio 0.4.3
It has the gradle build configurations and should be good to run,
but it may complain about your gradle settings and ask you to reconfigure your Android Studio path as it is set to mine in this example.
Select Check Out project from Version Coontrol in Android Studio.
There is also a link to check if the camera API is working, if it is then you are most likely good to go with Phonegap development.
